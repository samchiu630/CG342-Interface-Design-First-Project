            <h2>Yusuke Kozaki's Character Design</h2>
            <p>“Why is character design important in the first place?” He took a hard look at why we artists are essential, and what it is we have to contribute to a project. “Character design,” Mr. Kozaki said, “is the quickest and most effective way to convey both a specific character’s background and the game’s concept as a whole.” He also said, “Character design is an ode to humanity.” Personally, I love that sentiment. As a character designer, you have to be actively interested in the people around you – people you like, of course, but also people you don’t like! To design effective characters, you need to understand what it is that makes you feel certain ways about certain people. Mr. Kozaki really emphasized that a character designer must be interested in people. A designer’s fascination with humanity must transcend boundaries of age, sex and race; it must go beyond whether they think someone is good or bad. <a href="https://www.platinumgames.com/official-blog/article/9728" target="_blank">Click here to read more.</a></p>

            <h2>Yusuke Kozaki's Early Career</h2>
            <p>"I actually debuted as a manga artist first, as an assistant. But when I’d get done with the work as an assistant, I’d come home and build my personal illustration website. It was quite popular, actually, so I got a lot of hits. That’s how I started getting offers for character design."<a href="http://gaming.moe/?p=162" target="_blank">Click here to read more.</a></p>
