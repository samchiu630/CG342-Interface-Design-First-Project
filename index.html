            <h2>Early Career</h2>
            <p>"I actually debuted as a manga artist first, as an assistant. But when I’d get done with the work as an assistant, I’d come home and build my personal illustration website. It was quite popular, actually, so I got a lot of hits. That’s how I started getting offers for character design."<a href="http://gaming.moe/?p=162" class="button-link" target="_blank">Click here to read more.</a></p>

            <h2>Character Design</h2>
            <p>“Why is character design important in the first place?” He took a hard look at why we artists are essential, and what it is we have to contribute to a project. “Character design,” Mr. Kozaki said, “is the quickest and most effective way to convey both a specific character’s background and the game’s concept as a whole.” He also said, “Character design is an ode to humanity.” Personally, I love that sentiment. As a character designer, you have to be actively interested in the people around you – people you like, of course, but also people you don’t like! To design effective characters, you need to understand what it is that makes you feel certain ways about certain people. Mr. Kozaki really emphasized that a character designer must be interested in people. A designer’s fascination with humanity must transcend boundaries of age, sex and race; it must go beyond whether they think someone is good or bad. <a href="https://www.platinumgames.com/official-blog/article/9728" class="button-link" target="_blank">Click here to read more.</a></p>

            <h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>
            <p>"As an artist, it is natural to have feelings like, 'I want to draw the best picture I can,' or 'I want to draw something I’m satisfied with,' or even, 'I want to become better at drawing.' However, if you make this the main focus of your work, you may never be able to complete your drawing, or you may become afraid to draw because you are worried about its quality. Of course, whether you can feel satisfied with your work or not is an extremely important element for an artist. However, as a professional, it is your 'job' to please as many people as possible with your work. Therefore, I think it is important to focus not only on whether or not you are satisfied with your work, but also on whether or not your clients will be satisfied. Because you yourself know best what your weakest points are, oftentimes you may tend to aim too high. However, that would just continuously leave you in anguish. Even if you are not satisfied with your work, the customers are often satisfied and happy with it. I think an important attitude to have as a professional is to have various people see your work, and by observing their feedback, think about what you can do to please them even more. <a href="https://pokemonblog.com/2022/11/02/niantic-interviews-pokemon-go-character-designer-yusuke-kozaki-for-this-months-dev-diaries/" class="button-link" target="_blank">Click here to read more.</a></p>
